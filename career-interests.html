                    3M Corporate Headquarters<br>
                    3M Center, St. Paul, MN 55144-1000<br>

                <p>
                    I'm interested in 3M because it's one of the most innovative companies in the world. They combine business, science, and technology to solve everyday problems, which connects directly to what I'm learning as an MIS major. I like how 3M encourages creativity and teamwork, and I think it would be an amazing place to start a career in technology or business systems.

                <p>
                    As a sophomore studying Management Information Systems at UMD, I've built skills in Excel, data management, and systems analysis. I've learned how technology supports better business decisions, and I enjoy finding ways to make processes more efficient. I'm also good at working with others and communicating clearly, which are important at a large, fast-moving company like 3M.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My skills line up well with what 3M looks for—people who can connect technology with business strategy. I'm also drawn to their focus on sustainability and innovation, which are values I share and want to carry into my future career.
